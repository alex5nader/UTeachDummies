# UTeachDummies

## Inspiration
Our team has experience running Discord servers for our classes, and have always thought that a few Discord and bot features felt missing. UTeachDummies is a bot that implements some of these missing features.

## What it does
UTeachDummies has several features:
- Syncing of files with Google Drive
- Scheduled announcements
- Creation and management of free-to-join groups

## How we built it
UTeachDummies is built with Python using discord.py, and has integrations with Firebase and Google Drive.

## Challenges we ran into
Compared to Firebase, Google Drive's API is much more hands-on and detailed, so getting it to work how we wanted was challenging.

## What we learned
We gained valuable experience with Python, Firebase, and Google Cloud.
